# QMKL

QMKL is **Math Kernel Library for VideoCore IV QPU**.
QMKL is **compatible with Intel MKL**
except for double precision etc.

_**This repository is suspended currently!**_

This project has temporarily moved to [Idein Inc.](https://github.com/Idein)
and it's under closed development for better functionality and speed.
We are planning to re-open the code. Please wait a few!

We, Idein Inc., did some object recognition demos (GoogLeNet etc.) on Raspberry
Pi. The demos run on QPU with QMKL and our private libraries which are highly
optimized for neural networks. There are movies of that:
[Raspberry Pi 3](https://twitter.com/9_ties/status/858291781133148160) and
[Raspberry Pi Zero](https://twitter.com/9_ties/status/858300756092375040).


## Requirements

You need to install [qasm2](https://github.com/Terminus-IMRC/qpu-assembler2)
and [qbin2hex](https://github.com/Terminus-IMRC/qpu-bin-to-hex) to compile
this library. Just clone them and do `make && sudo make install`.


## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Terminus-IMRC/qmkl.git
$ cd qmkl/
$ cmake .
$ make
$ sudo make install
```


## Running tests

```
$ sudo test/sgemm
$ sudo test/scopy
$ sudo test/vsAbs
```

The results are [here](https://gist.github.com/Terminus-IMRC/1ec399a64edcacfc3040baf3c97f0895).
