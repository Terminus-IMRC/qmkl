# QMKL

QMKL is **Math Kernel Library for VideoCore IV QPU**. QMKL is **compatible with
Intel MKL** except for double precision etc.

_**This repository is moved to [Idein Inc.](https://github.com/Idein/qmkl).**_

We, Idein Inc., did some object recognition demos (GoogLeNet etc.) on Raspberry
Pi. The demos run on QPU with QMKL and our private libraries which are highly
optimized for neural networks. There are movies of that:
[Raspberry Pi 3](https://twitter.com/9_ties/status/858291781133148160) and
[Raspberry Pi Zero](https://twitter.com/9_ties/status/858300756092375040).
